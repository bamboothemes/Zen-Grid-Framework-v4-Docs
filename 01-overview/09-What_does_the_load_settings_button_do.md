What does the load settings button do?
======

The load settings button in Zen Grid Framework V4 (ZGF4) templates makes it possible to copy the settings from other ZGF4 styles in your Joomla installation, into the current template style. All theme, layout and other template data is copied to the current template style and it's values are replaced.

The select box lists the sample settings that come with the template as well as any other copies (styles) of the template's you have created in your site.
