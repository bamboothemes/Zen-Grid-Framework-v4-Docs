Accordion Settings
====

Zen Grid Framework v4 (ZGF4) themes come with the ability to transform a standard Joomla menu module published to a sidebar position into a collapsible accordion menu.

An accordion menu allows the user to view nested menu items in a menu by clicking on the parent item. ZGF4 menu's allow any type of menu item to act as a parent menu item.

The accordion comes with two options:
- A traditional accordion menu which allows a single nested menu item to be open at a time.
- Or a panel menu which allows multiple nested sub level items to be open at a time.
