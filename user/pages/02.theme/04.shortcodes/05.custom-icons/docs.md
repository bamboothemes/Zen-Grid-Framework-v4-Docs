## Custom icons

To add your own custom syntax add the names of the items  (separated by a comma) that you wish to use in your content eg happy, snail, belfast. Then click save.

Now when you use the syntax {zen-happy}My happy text{/zen-happy} the syntax will be rendered as per the following.

{zen-pre}html|<span class="zen-icon zen-happy">&lt;span class="zen-icon zen-happy"&gt;My happy text&lt;/span&gt;</span>{/zen-pre}

 The template will not render any specific styling for this new custom syntax but it makes it possible for you to add your own styling via a custom.css file to take advantage of this new syntax.
