A new addition to the Zen Shortcode plugin is the ability to specify custom syntax for your content. This means that in addition to using the built in syntax to display the icons listed below it is possible to use your own custom syntax to render new markup and displays.

To add your own syntax you enter the new names for your classes in the plugin settings in your sites Joomla extension manager. To navigate to these settings navigate to extensions &gt; plugin manager and filter the results to display the Zen Shortcode settings. Once you have entered the edit panel click on the options menu tab. This will display the options available for the plugin.
