## Preventing shortcodes from rendering in the browser page title.
As a means of providing improved performance for the Zen Shortcode plugin, the plugin will not reset any html added to your page titles. This means that in some instances you may see html markup in the browser tab / page title when viewing a page that uses shortcode syntax in the page title.

To remove the html markup simply go to the menu for that item in your menu manager and specify a page title for your item.
1. Edit the menu item in question
2. Navigate to the Page Display tab
3. Add your Browser page title without the shortcode syntax
4. Press save.

This will ensure that your browser page title does not contain any html.
