## Rendering buttons

The Zen Shortcode plugin is able to render buttons using the default .btn style built into the template. In order to render a button with a link attached simply add your link text followed by the pipe symbol - | - and the link you wish to attach to the button.

### Example
The syntax used to render buttons is as per follows.

{zen-btn}Google|http://www.google.com{/zen-btn}
