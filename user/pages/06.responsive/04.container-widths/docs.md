The container width setting int he Zen Grid Framework v4 allows the user to specify the maximum width that the main template container should be (as a % of the browser width) when the browser width is less than template width.

As an example if the template's width is set to 1140px and the desktop container width is set to 80%, then when the browser width is greater than 1140px then the template's main container will be no larger than 1140px. When the browser width is less than 1140px wide then the template container will be be 80% of the width of the screen.
