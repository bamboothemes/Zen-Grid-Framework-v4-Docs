s:843:"<p>This tutorial shows the user how to change the name of an existing module position in your template.</p>
<h2>Change the name of the position in the positions.json file</h2>
<p>The first step is to open the settings/layout/positions.json file. In this example we will change the name of the top1 position to "opening."</p>
<p>In this case:</p>
<pre><code>"top": {
    "top1": "3",
    "top2": "3",
    "top3": "3",
    "top4": "3"
},</code></pre>
<p>becomes</p>
<pre><code>"top": {
    "opening": "3",
    "top2": "3",
    "top3": "3",
    "top4": "3"
},</code></pre>
<p>Once you have made that change you will see in the template admin that a position called opening is now available in the space where the top1 position had previously been.</p>
