s:1352:"<h2>Adding effects and using additional classes for Shortcode icons.</h2>
<p>v1.3+ of the plugin allows the user to specify some of the options seen on the <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/examples/">Font Awesome examples page</a>.</p>
<p>To take advantage of the effects in your content you need to follow the syntax specified below.</p>
<pre><code>{zen-iconname}effect1|effect2:Content{/zen-iconname}</code></pre>
<p>A real world example of this may look like the following:</p>
<pre><code>{zen-heart}spin|3x:This is my content{/zen-heart}</code></pre>
<p>Add that code to your content item will result in a heart icon being rendered on the page that also spins and is 3 three times the size of the standard font size for that tag. In addition to the words "This is my content" would be rendered after the icon.</p>
<p>Please Note:
Effects need to be separated using the | symbol.
Content must be preceded by the : symbol.</p>
<h2>Advanced delimiter option</h2>
<p>This is an option that was added to v1.4.0 of the plugin.</p>
<p>Enabling this option changes the delimiter to ||| rather than the default delimiter which is |.</p>
<p>To enable this go to the extensions manager in your Joomla site and edit the Zen Shortcode settings.</p>
