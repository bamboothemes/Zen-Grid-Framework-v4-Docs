<p>Here you will find 4 options to choose from:</p>
<h3>Selector for a custom font</h3>
<p>This is the selector you wish to apply the new font for. You can use a custom selector as shown in the screenshot above or use a tag such as h1,h2,h3 or blockquote. If you wish to apply the font to multiple selectors then you would simply add the selector to the input box using a comma to separate each rule eg h1,2,blockquote,.myspecific-rule.</p>
<h3>Select font to load</h3>
<p>This is the same option used for the other items. Select between a set of standard fonts or choose the google font option.</p>
<h3>Google Font - Custom</h3>
<p>If the Google font option was specified in the previous option this setting will appear. Simply add the google font you wish to use.</p>
<h3>CSS to be applied to custom font</h3>
<p>This textarea allows the user to attach specific css rules to the new selector. Any valid css can be used here. eg color:red;font-size:3em.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>If the settings from the screenshot above are applied then the following code will be output in the page:</p>
<pre><code>.myspecific-rule {font-family:lato;color:red;font-size:3em}</code></pre>";
